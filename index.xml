My website has some hacky code snippets for certain parts of it. I know that being sloppy from the beggining is never a good omen so I try to be as strict as possible with myself.
At the homepage, I include a simple section with fontawesome icons about my profiles in other social networks:
This is the hacky code that was used for this:</description></item><item><title>Matching /dev/hidraw* devices with physical devices</title><link>/post/matching-dev-hidraw-devices-with-physical-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:07:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>/post/matching-dev-hidraw-devices-with-physical-devices/</guid><description>During development of ContourUSB device driver (I&amp;rsquo; ve dedicated a post for this one) I had a hard time detecting the hidraw device created for the meter. I&amp;rsquo; ve been suggested to just print all available hidraw devices (pseudo files), then plug the meter and re-print hidraw devices to detect which one was just created. While this worked I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really thrilled with the approach.

I still casually maintain the addon, although the time I can dedicate for such projects is getting reduced day by day. The addon is already used by a great number of users worldwide, translated in many languages (that would be many more if I had the time to standardize the whole localization process but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different story to tell), and at the time of writing is the second most popular extension in LibreOffice Extensions, and the first most popular Writer extension.</description></item><item><title>Blog</title><link>/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description>Interested in working together or just chat?

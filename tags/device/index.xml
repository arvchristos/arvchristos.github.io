You can find the project code on GitHub
This exercise contains the implementation of a character device driver for a wireless network of sensors. Those sensors are connected in a mesh network and provide data to e central collecting station. Each of those sensors collects brightness, temperature as well as sensor battery voltage levels.</description></item></channel></rss>

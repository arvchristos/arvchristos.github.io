I still casually maintain the addon, although the time I can dedicate for such projects is getting reduced day by day. The addon is already used by a great number of users worldwide, translated in many languages (that would be many more if I had the time to standardize the whole localization process but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different story to tell), and at the time of writing is the second most popular extension in LibreOffice Extensions, and the first most popular Writer extension.</description></item></channel></rss>
